## Running InQuery App

InQuery offers various configuration options for running the engine observability application. The Engine Observability option requires a connection to a database with live query logs from either the MySQL or or http event listener plug-ins. Depending on your requirements and setup, you can choose one of the following options:

### Pre-Hosted Database with Trino Cluster (Cloud):

- These instructions assume you are hosting your own Trino cluster and database in the cloud. Running the application with a pre-hosted Database and Trino Cluster in the cloud? No problem! [Check out the instructions provided in this guide](docs/inquery-app-cloud.md).

    ### Database Supports
    - PostgreSQL
    - MySQL

### Dockerized Database with Dockerized Trino Cluster (Local):

- For a local setup, where both the Database and Trino Cluster are Dockerized, [refer to this guide for detailed steps](docs/inquery-app-local.md).

    ### Database Supports
    - PostgreSQL

Choose the setup that best fits your needs and start exploring InQuery App!
